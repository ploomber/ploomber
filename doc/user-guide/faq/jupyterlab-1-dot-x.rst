Can I use Ploomber in old JupyterLab ``1.x`` versions?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes! Although our JupyterLab plug-in requires version ``2.x``, you can still
use Ploomber if using the old ``1.x`` version, which (as of December 2021) is the
case if you're using **Amazon Sagemaker**. Since Ploomber is a command-line
tool, it is independent of your editor/IDE. Furthermore, you can get the same
experience as JupyerLab users by using the
``ploomber nb`` command; :doc:`click here to learn more. <editors>`
