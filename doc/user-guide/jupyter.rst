Jupyter integration
===================

.. note::

    This guide is applicable if running JupyterLab ``>=2.x``. If running older
    versions or using other editors (such as VSCode or PyCharm), check out
    the :doc:`../user-guide/editors` guide.

Ploomber integrates with Jupyter to make it easy to create multi-stage
pipelines composed of small notebooks. Breaking down logic in multiple
steps allows you to develop modularized pipelines that are easier to maintain
and deploy.

Before executing scripts or notebooks, Ploomber injects a new cell that
replaces the ``upstream`` variable at the top of the notebook (which only
contains dependency names) with a dictionary that maps these names to their
corresponding output files to use as inputs in the current task.

For example if a Python script (``task.py``) declares the following dependency:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor
    :name: task-py

    upstream = ['another-task']


And ``another-task`` has the following ``product`` definition:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :class: text-editor

    tasks:
        - source: another-task.py
          product:
            nb: output/another-task.ipynb
            data: output/another-task.parquet


The following cell will be injected in ``task.py`` before execution:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor

    # this is injected automatically
    upstream = {'another_task': {'nb': 'output/another-task.ipynb',
                                 'data': 'output/another-task.parquet'}}


The cell injection process happens during execution and development, allowing
you to develop pipelines interactively.

.. note::
    
    When using ``jupyter notebook``, scripts automatically render as
    notebooks. If using ``jupyter lab``: ``Right-click`` -> ``Open With``
    -> ``Notebook`` as depicted below:

.. image:: https://ploomber.io/images/doc/lab-open-with-notebook.png
   :target: https://ploomber.io/images/doc/lab-open-with-notebook.png
   :alt: lab-open-with-notebook

.. note::

   If you want to configure JuptyerLab to open ``.py`` files as notebooks with a
   single click, see the
   :ref:`corresponding section <opening-files-as-notebooks-with-a-single-click>`.


.. important::

    :ref:`Task-level <tasks-on-render-finish-failure>` and
    :ref:`DAG-level <on-render-finish-failure>` hooks
    are **not** executed when opening scripts/notebooks in Jupyter.


Interactive development
-----------------------

You can develop entire pipelines without leaving Jupyter. The fastest way to get
started is to use the ``ploomber scaffold`` command, which creates a base
project, check out the guide to learn more: :doc:`../user-guide/scaffold`.

Once you have a ``pipeline.yaml`` file, you may add new tasks and run
``ploomber scaffold`` again to create base scripts. For example, say you
create a ``pipeline.yaml`` like this:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :class: text-editor

    tasks:
      - source: scripts/get.py
        product:
          nb: output/get.ipynb
          data: output/get.csv

      - source: scripts/clean.py
        product:
          nb: output/clean.ipynb
          data: output/clean.csv
    
      - source: scripts/fit.py
        product:
          nb: output/fit.ipynb
          model: output/model.pickle

Once you execute ``ploomber scaffold``, you'll see the three new scripts
under the ``scripts/`` directory. You can then start adding the relationships
between tasks.


.. _modifying-the-upstream-variable:

The ``upstream`` variable
-------------------------

Let's say your ``scripts/clean.py`` script cleans some raw data. That means
you want to use the raw data as input (which is downloaded by
``scripts/get.py``), you can modify the ``upstream`` variable to establish this
execution dependency.


.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor
    :name: clean-py

    # ensure we get the data, and then we clean it
    upstream = ['get']


To inject the cell, reload the file from disk:

.. image:: https://ploomber.io/images/doc/lab-reload-file.png
   :target: https://ploomber.io/images/doc/lab-reload-file.png
   :alt: lab-reload-file


Then, you'll see something like this:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor

    # injected cell
    upstream = {'get': 'nb': 'output/clean.ipynb', 'data': 'output/clean.csv'}


Now you can continue developing your cleaning logic without hardcoding any
paths. Furthermore, when executing your pipeline, Ploomber will
run ``scripts/get.py`` and then ``scripts/clean.py``

.. important::
    
    Ploomber needs to parse your ``pipeline.yaml`` file to inject cells
    in your scripts/notebooks; if an error happens during the parsing process, you
    won't see any injected cells. Check out
    the :ref:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting-pipeline-loading>` section below
    for details.

Choosing the source format
--------------------------

Ploomber supports scripts and notebooks as source formats for tasks. We
recommend using ``.py`` files, but you can use the traditional ``.ipynb`` format
if you prefer so. As long as your file has a tag named ``parameters``, it will
work fine (`click here <https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage-parameterize.html>`_ to learn how to add the ``parameters`` cell)

The advantage of using ``.py`` files is that they're much easier to manage with
git, the disadvantage is that ``.py`` only contain code (not output), so after
editing your ``.py`` file, you need to run the task to create the executed
notebook (the one you declare as a product of the task).

However, if you want a more ipynb-like experience with ``.py`` files, you can
use `jupytext's pairing feature <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paired-notebooks.html>`_
to sync the output of a ``.py`` to a ``.ipynb`` file.

We rely on Jupytext for the ``.py`` to ``.ipynb`` conversion so that you can use
any of the ``.py`` flavors, here are some examples:

Light format
************

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor
    :name: light-format-py

    # + tags=["parameters"]
    upstream = None
    product = None

    # +
    # another cell


Percent format
**************

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor
    :name: percent-format-py

    # %% tags=["parameters"]
    upstream = None
    product = None

    # %%
    # another cell


`Check out Jupytext documentation <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats-scripts.html>`_ for more details on the supported formats.

Activating the Jupyter extension
--------------------------------
.. note::
    
    For tips on troubleshooting pipeline loading, see :ref:`Troubleshooting pipeline loading`.

In most cases, the extension configures when you install Ploomber; you can verify this by running:

.. code-block:: console

    jupyter serverextension list


If Ploomber appears in the list, it means it's activated. If it doesn't show
up, you can manually activate it with:

.. code-block:: console

    jupyter serverextension enable ploomber

To disable it:

.. code-block:: console

    jupyter serverextension disable ploomber


.. important::

    If you want to use the extension in a hosted environment
    (JupyterHub, Domino, SageMaker, etc.), ensure Ploomber is installed
    **before** JupyterLab spins up. Usually, hosted platforms allow you to write
    a custom start script: add a ``pip install ploomber`` line, and you'll be
    ready to go. If you cannot get the extension to work, post a question
    in the ``#ask-anything`` channel on
    `Slack <https://ploomber.io/community>`_. Alternatively, you may replicate
    the extension's functionality using the command line, check out the
    :doc:`this guide <editors>` to learn more.

Custom Jupyter pipeline loading
-------------------------------

When you start the Jupyter app (via the ``jupyter notebook/lab`` command), the
extension looks for a ``pipeline.yaml`` file in the current directory and
parent directories. If it finds one, it will load the pipeline and inject
the appropriate cell if the existing file is a task in the loaded pipeline.

If your pipeline spec has a different name, you can create a ``setup.cfg`` file
and indicate what file you want to load. Note that **changing the
default affects both the command-line interface and the Jupyter plug-in**.

.. code-block:: cfg
    :class: text-editor
    :name: setup-cfg

    [ploomber]
    entry-point = path/to/pipeline.yaml

Note that paths are relative to the parent directory of ``setup.cfg``.

Alternatively, you can set the ``ENTRY_POINT``
environment variable. For example, to load a ``pipeline.serve.yaml``:

.. code-block:: console

    export ENTRY_POINT=pipeline.serve.yaml
    jupyter lab


.. important::
    
    ``export ENTRY_POINT`` must be executed in the same process that spins up
    JupyterLab. If you change it, you'll need to start JupyterLab again


Note that ``ENTRY_POINT`` must be a file name and not a path. When you start
Jupyter, Ploomber will look for that file in the current and parent directories
until it finds one.

.. collapse:: changelog

    .. versionadded:: 0.19.6
        Support for switching entry point with a ``setup.cfg`` file

.. _troubleshooting-pipeline-loading:

Troubleshooting pipeline loading
--------------------------------
.. note::
    
    For tips on activating the Jupyter extension, see :ref:`Activating the Jupyter extension`.

If a pipeline is not detected, the Jupyter notebook application will work
as expected, but no cell injection will happen. You can see if Ploomber could
not detect a pipeline by looking at the messages displayed after
initializing Jupyter (the terminal window where you executed the
``jupyter notebook/lab`` command, you'll see something like this:

.. code-block:: console

    [Ploomber] Skipping DAG initialization since there isn't a project root in the current or parent directories. Error message: {SOME_MESSAGE}


The message above means that Ploomber could not locate a ``pipeline.yaml`` file
to use for cell injection, take a look at the entire error message as it will
contain more details to help you fix the problem. A common mistake is not to
include a ``pipeline.yaml`` file in the same directory (or parent) of the script/notebook you're editing.

If a ``pipeline.yaml`` is found but fails to initialize, the Jupyter console
will show another error message:

.. code-block:: console

    [Ploomber] An error occurred when trying to initialize the pipeline.


A common reason for this is an invalid ``pipeline.yaml`` file.

Note that even if your pipeline is missing or fails to initialize,
Jupyter will start anyway, so ensure to take a look at the console if you
experience problems.

Another common situation is ``ModuleNotFoundError`` errors. Jupyter must
parse your pipeline in the process that runs the Jupyter application itself.
If your pipeline contains dotted paths (e.g., tasks that are Python functions,
task hooks, task clients, etc.), loading the pipeline will fail if such dotted
paths are not importable. Scripts and notebooks are handled differently. Hence,
a pipeline whose tasks are all notebooks/scripts won't have this issue.

If you cannot find the problem, you can move to a directory that stores
any of the scripts that aren't having the cell injected, start a Python
session and run:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: ipython

    from ploomber import lazily_load_entry_point; lazily_load_entry_point()

``lazily_load_entry_point`` is the function that Ploomber uses internally
to initialize your pipeline. Calling this function allows you to replicate
the same conditions when initializing your pipeline for cell injection.

Detecting changes
-----------------

Ploomber parses your pipeline whenever you open a file to detect changes.
The parsing runtime depends on the number of tasks, and although it is
fast, it may slow down file loading in pipelines with lots of tasks. You can
turn off continuous parsing by setting ``jupyter_hot_reload`` (in the ``meta``
section) option to ``False``. You'll have to restart Jupyter if you turn this
option off to detect changes.

Managing multiple pipelines
---------------------------

Jupyter can detect more than one pipeline in a single project.
There are two ways to achieve this.

The first one is to create sibling folders, each one with its own
``pipeline.yaml``:

.. code-block:: sh

    some-pipeline/
        pipeline.yaml
        some-script.py
    another-pipeline/
        pipeline.yaml
        another-script.py

Since Ploomber looks for a ``pipeline.yaml`` file in the current directory
and parents, it will correctly find the appropriate file if you open
``some-script.py`` or ``another-script.py`` (assuming they're already declared
as tasks in their corresponding ``pipeline.yaml``.


.. important::
    
    If using Python functions as tasks, you must use different module
    names for each pipeline. Otherwise, the module imports first will be cached
    and used for the other pipeline. See the following example.


.. code-block:: sh

    some-pipeline/
        pipeline.yaml
        some_tasks.py
    another-pipeline/
        pipeline.yaml
        other_tasks.py


The second option is to keep a unique project root and name each pipeline
differently:

.. code-block:: sh

    pipeline.yaml
    some-script.py
    pipeline.another.yaml
    another-script.py

In this case, Ploomber will load ``pipeline.yaml`` by default, but you can
switch this by setting the ``ENTRY_POINT`` variable to the other spec.
(e.g., ``pipeline.another.yaml``). Note that the environment variable must be
a filename and not a path.


Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------------------

There are two ways to use Ploomber in Jupyter. The first one is by opening a
task file in Jupyter (i.e., the source file is listed in your ``pipeline.yaml``
file.

Another way is to load your pipeline in Jupyter to interact with it. This second
approach is best when you already have some tasks, and you want to explore their
outputs to decide how to proceed with further analysis.

Say that you have a single task that loads the data:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :class: text-editor

    tasks:
        - source: load.py
          product:
            nb: output/load.ipynb
            data: output/data.csv


If you want to explore the raw data to decide how to organize downstream tasks (i.e., for data
cleaning). You can create a new notebook with the following code:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor
    :name: exploratory-ipynb

    from ploomber.spec import DAGSpec
    
    dag = DAGSpec.find().to_dag()


Note that this exploratory notebook **is not** part of your pipeline (i.e., it
doesn't appear in the ``tasks`` section of your ``pipeline.yaml``), it's an
independent notebook that loads your pipeline declaration.

The ``dag`` variable is an object that contains your pipeline definition. If you
want to load your raw data:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor

    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv(dag['load'].product)

Using the ``dag`` object avoids hardcoded paths to keep notebooks clean.

There are other things you can do with the ``dag`` object. See the following
guide for more examples: :ref:`user-guide-cli-interactive-sessions`.

As your pipeline grows, exploring it from Jupyter helps you decide what tasks to
build next and understand dependencies among tasks.

If you want to take a quick look at your pipeline, you may use
``ploomber interact`` from a terminal to get the ``dag`` object.

.. _opening-files-as-notebooks-with-a-single-click:

Opening ``.py`` files as notebooks with a single click
-------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to open ``.py`` files as notebooks in ``JuptyerLab`` with a
single click (this requires ``jupytext>=1.13.2``).

If using ``ploomber>=0.14.7``, you can enable this with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    ploomber nb --single-click


To disable:

.. code-block:: console

    ploomber nb --single-click-disable


If running earlier versions of Ploomber, you can enable this by changing the
default viewer for text notebooks. For instructions,
`see jupytext's documentation <https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#install>`_
(click on the triangle right before the ``With a click on the text file in JupyterLab`` section).
