Setting Up
==========

This is a beta functionality, as such, the API might change in the future.
To get this functionality you'll have to upgrade to the latest version.

.. code-block:: console

    pip install ploomber --upgrade

You can then run a sanity check to make sure you have cloud support:

.. code-block:: console

    ploomber cloud --help
