allows you to export to:

1. `Kubernetes <https://soopervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/kubernetes.html>`_ (via `Argo workflows <https://argoproj.github.io/>`_)
2. `AWS Batch <https://soopervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/aws-batch.html>`_
3. `Airflow <https://soopervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/airflow.html>`_
