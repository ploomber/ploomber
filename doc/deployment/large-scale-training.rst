Large-scale training
====================

Ploomber pipelines can export to distributed workflow orchestrators for
large-scale training. Check out our package
`Soopervisor <https://soopervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which
allows you to export to
`Kubernetes <https://soopervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/kubernetes.html>`_
(via `Argo workflows <argoproj.github.io/>`_),
`AWS Batch <https://soopervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/aws-batch.html>`_,
and `Airflow <https://soopervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/airflow.html>`_.
