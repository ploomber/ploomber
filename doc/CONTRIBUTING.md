# Contributing to Ploomber's documentation

## Setup with conda

The simplest way to setup the environment is via conda. [Click here for miniconda installation details](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).


```sh
# invoke is needed to run the next command
pip install invoke

# install dev + doc dependencies
invoke setup --doc
```

Then activate the environment:

```sh
conda activate ploomber
```

## Setup with pip

If you don't want to install conda, you can setup the environment with pip:

*Note* we highly recommend you to install dependencies in a virtual environment. See the *Setup with pip* section in the main [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details.

```sh
# invoke is needed to run the next command
pip install invoke

# install dev + doc dependencies
invoke setup-pip --doc
```

*Note* there are some minor caveats when installing using git, see the *Caveats of installing with pip* in the main [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details.

## Build docs

```
invoke docs
```

To see the docs, open `doc/_build/html/index.html`


## Layout

Documentation files are under `doc/`. CSS, JS, and images are under `doc/_static`, and HTML templates are under `doc/_templates`. The documentation content are all the files under `doc/` with `.rst` extension. They are converted to `.html` when building the documentation.

Once the documentation is built, you'll see a `doc/_build` folder. Do not edit these files, since building the documentation again will overwrite results. If you want to edit the content, edit the `.rst` files, if you want to edit the layout, edit the files in `doc/_static` or `doc/_templates`.


## Editing code snippets

To make the docs clear, we distinguish between a Python script and a Python
session by adding CSS to each code snippet, the same happens for bash
scripts and bash sessions. This requires you to use the appropriate Pygments
lexer depending on what you are showing:

https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/

Summary:
* `python` for Python scripts
* `pycon` for Python sessions (Note: add >>> at the beginning of each line)
* `pytb` for Python tracebacks (Note: only works if you copy the whole traceback)
* `sh` For bash scripts
* `console` For terminal sessions
* `postgresql` For SQL templated scripts (`sql` does not work)

If nothing applies, don't add any lexer.

## Pages generated from notebooks

Some pages in the documentation are pulled from a separate repository, you can identify them because they're Jupyter notebooks ([here's an example](https://docs.ploomber.io/en/latest/get-started/first-pipeline.html)), if you want to contribute to one of those, you open your Pull Request in the [projects repository](https://github.com/ploomber/projects).

If such notebooks link to other documents, use relative paths, so they work locally as well:

e.g.:

```md
[some-label](../api/testing.rst)
```

## Working with .rst files

Pages in the documentation are built using `.rst` files and built using `Sphinx`. Here are a few suggestions to make
contributing `.rst` files easier. 

#### Hyperlinks (external)

Within an `.rst` file, you can use the following format 

    `Link text <https://domain.invalid/>`_ 
    
for inline web links. Note: If you want the text to display the full link, the parser will find and links along with 
mail addresses. Ensure there is a space between the word to be embedded and the link.

Read more [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#hyperlinks).

#### Adding images

You can use the following notation to embed an image `.. image:: gnu.png`.  Where `gnu.png` is relative to the source file, 
or relative to the top source directory. 

To learn more about setting image size, or for information on Sphinx version changes, visit [this link](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#images).

#### Python code blocks

To embed a Python code block within an `.rst` file, refer to the following sample

```
.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 3,5

   def some_function():
       interesting = False
       print 'This line is highlighted.'
       print 'This one is not...'
       print '...but this one is.'
```

#### Ensuring Algolia Crawler Works With Code Snippets

Login to [algolia crawler](https://crawler.algolia.com). Select ploomber in the crawlers section. Select Editor from the side bar. This allows you to make edits to the config file. To add code snippets to the indexing, I appended  `pre` to the array assigned to `content`, which is under the `recordProps` property. This is because  code blocks are within a `<pre>` tag in HTML. After making edits, you can use the URL Tester to test. Click save when you are ready. After clicking save, exit the text editor and restart the crawler. After the crawler finishes restarting, Docsearch should be updated on the site.
