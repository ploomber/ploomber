What is Ploomber?
=================

Ploomber is a framework to build collaborative and modular pipelines; it integrates with Jupyter
but you can use it with any other editor.

Ploomber eliminates the *notebook refactoring problem*: data
teams prototype their work in Jupyter notebooks and then refactor
the code for deployment. Such refactoring process comes with a high risk, since
it steeply increases the chance of breaking the analysis when moving the code
around, and slows down progress.

**With Ploomber, you can develop maintainable, collaborative, and production-ready pipelines from day one.**
