Basic concepts
==============

This guide explains Ploomber's core concepts.

Ploomber allows you to quickly turn a collection of scripts, notebooks, or functions into a data pipeline by following three conventions:

1. Each task is a function, script or notebook.
2. Tasks declare their dependencies using an ``upstream`` variable.
3. Tasks declare their outputs using a ``product`` variable.

A simple pipeline
-----------------

Let's say we want to build a pipeline to plot some data. Instead of coding
everything in a single file, we'll break down logic in three steps, which will
make our code more maintainable and easier to test:

.. raw:: html
   
    <div class="mermaid">
    graph LR
        1-raw --> 2-clean --> 3-plot
    </div>


.. note:: A pipeline is also known as a directed acyclic graph (or DAG). We use both of these terms interchangeably.

In a Ploomber pipeline, outputs (also known as **products**) from one
task become inputs of "downstream" tasks. Hence, "upstream" dependencies read
from left to right. For example, ``raw`` is an "upstream" dependency of ``clean``.

An "upstream" dependency implies that a given task uses its upstream products
as inputs. Following the pipeline example, ``clean`` uses ``raw``'s products, and ``plot`` uses ``clean``'s products.

Ploomber supports three types of tasks:

1. Python functions (also known as callables)
2. Python scripts/notebooks (and their R equivalents)
3. SQL scripts

You can mix any combination of tasks in your pipeline. For example, you can dump data with a
SQL query, then plot it with Python.

Defining a pipeline
-------------------

To execute a pipeline, Ploomber needs to know the location of the
task's source code (``source`` key), and the location of the task's products
(``product`` key). You can do this via a ``pipeline.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :class: text-editor
    :name: pipeline-yaml

    tasks:
      # this is a sql script task
      - source: raw.sql
        product: [schema, name, table]
        # ...

      # this is a function task
      # "my_functions.clean" is equivalent to: from my_functions import clean
      - source: my_functions.clean
        product: output/clean.csv

      # this is a script task (notebooks work the same)
      - source: plot.py
        product:
          # scripts always generate a notebook (more on this in the next section)
          nb: output/plots.ipynb
         


.. note:: You can set a task name using ``name``. If not present, Ploomber infers it from the ``source`` value by removing the extension to the file's name.

Once you have a ``pipeline.yaml`` file, you can run it with:

.. code-block:: console

   ploomber build

Ploomber keeps track of source changes to skip up-to-date tasks. If you run
``ploomber build`` again, only tasks whose source code has changed
are executed. This helps iterate faster, as changes to the pipeline only
trigger the least number of tasks.

.. tip::
   
   You can use the ``resources_`` section in a task definition to tell
   Ploomber to track the content of other
   files. :ref:`Click here to learn more <tasks-params-resources>`.

For a full reference on ``pipeline.yaml`` files see: :doc:`../api/spec`.

Let's now see how to use scripts and notebooks as pipeline tasks.

Tasks: scripts/notebooks
------------------------

Jupyter notebooks files (``.ipynb``) contain both code and output; while convenient, keeping code and outputs in the
same file makes version control (i.e., ``git``) difficult.

Our recommended approach is to use scripts as sources. However, thanks to the
integration with Jupyter, **you can open scripts as notebooks**. The
following image shows a side-by-side comparison of the same source code
as ``.py`` (script) and as a ``.ipynb`` (notebook) file:

.. image:: /_static/img/basics/py-and-ipynb.png
   :target: /_static/img/basics/py-and-ipynb.png
   :alt: py-and-ipynb

Note that the ``.py`` script has some ``# %%`` comments. Such markers allow us
to delimit code cells and render the ``.py`` file as a notebook. 

.. note::
   
   The ``# %%`` is one way of representing ``.py`` as notebooks. Ploomber
   uses ``jupytext`` to perform the conversion, other formats such as the
   "light" (``# +``) format work too. Editors such as VS Code, Spyder, and
   PyCharm support the "percent" format.


To keep the benefits of the ``.ipynb`` format, **Ploomber creates a
copy of your scripts, converts them to .ipynb at runtime and executes them.** This is a
crucial concept: scripts are part of your project's source code, but executed
notebooks are pipeline products.

.. note:: Even though we recommend the use of ``.py`` files, you you can still use regular ``.ipynb`` files as sources if you prefer so.

To know more about integration with Jupyter notebooks, see the :doc:`../user-guide/jupyter` guide.

:doc:`R scripts/notebooks <../user-guide/r-support>` are supported as well.

``upstream`` and ``product``
****************************

To specify task dependencies, include a special ``parameters`` cell in your
script/notebook. Following the example pipeline, ``clean`` has ``raw``
as an upstream dependency as the **raw** task is an input to
the **clean** task. We establish this relation by declaring an ``upstream``
variable with a list of task names that should execute **before** the file we're
editing. If a script/notebook has no dependencies, set ``upstream = None``.

.. code-block:: python
    :class: text-editor
    :name: clean-py

    # %% tags=["parameters"]
    upstream = ['raw'] # this means: execute raw.py, then clean.py
    product = None


.. important::

   ``product = None`` is a placeholder. It states that our script takes an input
   parameter called ``product``, but the actual value is automatically replaced
   at runtime, we explain this in the upcoming section.

.. note::
   
   the ``# %%`` markers only apply to scripts.
   `Click here <https://docs.ploomber.io/en/latest/user-guide/faq_index.html#parameterizing-notebooks>`_
   for information on adding tags to ``.ipynb`` files.


The cell injection process
**************************
.. note::
    
    For tips on troubleshooting pipeline loading, see :ref:`Troubleshooting pipeline loading`.
    

Let's review the contents a sample ``clean.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python
   :class: text-editor

   import pandas as pd

   # %% tags=["parameters"]
   upstream = ['raw']
   product = None

   # %%
   df = pd.read_csv(upstream['raw']['data'])
   # some data cleaning code...

   # %%
   # store clean data
   df.to_csv(str(product['data']), index=False)


This code will break if we run it: We declared ``raw`` as
an upstream dependency, but we don't know where to load our inputs from, or
where to save our outputs.

**When executing your pipeline, Ploomber injects a new cell** into each
script/notebooks, with new ``product`` and ``upstream`` variables that
replace the original ones by extracting information from the
``pipeline.yaml``:

.. image:: /_static/img/basics/injected.png
   :target: /_static/img/basics/injected.png
   :alt: injected-cell


As you can see in the image, the task in the picture has an upstream
dependency called ``raw``. Thus, the injected cell has a dictionary that gives
you the products of ``raw``, which we use as input, and a new ``product``
variable that we use to store our outputs.

The cell injection process also happens when opening the notebook/script in Jupyter. Learn more about
:ref:`Cell injection and Jupyter integration <modifying-the-upstream-variable>`.


.. note::
   
   When using ``jupyter notebook``, scripts open automatically as
   notebooks. If using ``jupyter lab``, you have to click right and select the
   notebook option.

Since scripts/notebooks always create an executed notebook, you must specify
where to save such a file. A typical task declaration looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :class: text-editor

    tasks:
      - source: plot.py
        # output notebook
        product: output/plots.ipynb

If the source script/notebook generates more than one output, create a
dictionary under ``product``:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :class: text-editor

    tasks:
      - source: plot.py
        product:
          # if the script generates other products, use "nb" for the notebok
          nb: output/plots.ipynb
          # ...and any other keys for other files
          data: output/data.csv


This covers scripts and notebooks as tasks, if you want to learn how to use
functions as tasks, keep scrolling, otherwise, :ref:`skip to the end. <where-to-go-from-here>`


Tasks: functions
----------------

You can also use functions as tasks, the following section explains how.

``upstream`` and ``product``
****************************

The only requirement for a function to be a valid task is to have a ``product`` parameter.

.. code-block:: python
   :class: text-editor
   :name: my_functions-py

   import pandas as pd

   def clean(product):
      # save output using the product argument
      df.to_csv(product)


.. note:: If the function generates many products, this becomes a dictionary, for example: ``product['one']``, and ``product['another']``.

If the task has upstream dependencies, add an ``upstream`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python
   :class: text-editor

   import pandas as pd

   def clean(product, upstream):
      df_input = pd.read_csv(upstream['task_name'])
      df.to_csv(product)

When resolving dependencies, Ploomber will look for references such as
``upstream['task_name']``, then, during execution, Ploomber will pass the
requested inputs. For example, ``upstream={'task_name': 'path/to/product/from/upstream.csv'}``


This covers scripts and functions as tasks, if you want to learn how to use
SQL scripts as tasks, keep scrolling, otherwise, :ref:`skip to the end. <where-to-go-from-here>`

Tasks: SQL
----------

SQL tasks require more setup because you have to configure a ``client`` to
connect to the database. We explain the ``product`` and ``upstream`` mechanism
here; an :doc:`upcoming guide <sql-pipeline>` describes how to configure database clients.

``upstream`` and ``product``
****************************

SQL scripts require placeholders for ``product`` and ``upstream``. A script
that has no upstream dependencies looks like this:

.. code-block:: postgresql
   :class: text-editor
   :name: raw-sql

   CREATE TABLE {{product}} AS -- {{product}} is a placeholder
   SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column > 10

In your ``pipeline.yaml`` file, specify ``product`` with a list of 3
or 2 elements: ``[schema, name, table]`` or ``[name, table]``. If using a
view, use ``[schema, name, view]``. For example:

Say you have ``product: [schema, name, table]`` in your ``pipeline.yaml`` file.
The ``{{product}}`` placeholder is replaced by ``schema.name``:

.. code-block:: postgresql
   :class: text-editor
   :name: raw-sql

   CREATE TABLE schema.name AS
   SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column > 10

If the script has upstream dependencies, use the ``{{upstream['task_name']}}``
placeholder:

.. code-block:: postgresql
   :class: text-editor
   :name: raw-sql

   CREATE TABLE {{product}} AS
   SELECT * FROM {{upstream['task_name']}} WHERE my_column > 10

``{{upstream['task_name']}}`` tells Ploomber to run the task with the name
``'task_name'`` and to replace ``{{upstream['task_name']}}`` with the
product of such task.

Clients
*******

To establish a connection with a database, you have to configure a ``client``.
All databases that have a Python driver are supported, including systems like
Snowflake or Apache Hive. To learn more, see the :doc:`SQL guide <sql-pipeline>`.
