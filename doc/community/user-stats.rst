User Statistics
==========

As an open source project, we collect anonymous usage statistics to prioritize and find product gaps.
This is optional and may be turned off by changing the configuration file:
 inside ~/.ploomber/stats/config.yaml
 Change stats_enabled to False.

The data we collect is limited to:

- The Ploomber version currently running.
- A generated UUID, randomized when the initial install takes place, no personal or any identifiable information.
- Environment variables: The OS architecture Ploomber is used in (Python version etc.)
- Information about the different product phases: installation, API calls and errors.
