sphinx:
  configuration: doc/conf.py

formats: all

# create conda env from that file
conda:
  environment: doc/environment.yml


# install package with pip[all] from this directory
# no longer installing here since read the docs uses --upgrade-strategy eager
# which breaks the build due to nbsphinx incompatibility with jinja2>=3.0.0
# installing in doc/environment.yml instead
# python:
#   install:
#     - method: pip
#       path: .
#       extra_requirements:
#         - all
