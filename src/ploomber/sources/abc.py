class Source(abc.ABC):
    """Source abstract class

    Sources encapsulate the code that will be executed. Tasks only focus on
    execution and sources take care of the source code lifecycle: import,
    render (add parameter and validate) then hand off execution to the Task
    object.

    They validation logic is optional and is done at init time to prevent
    Tasks from being instantiated with ill-defined sources. For example, a
    SQLScript is expected to create a table/view, if the source does not
    contain a CREATE TABLE/VIEW statement, then validation could prevent this
    source code from executing. Validation can also happen after rendering.
    For example, a PythonCallableSource checks that the passed Task.params are
    compatible with the source function signature.

    A new Task does not mean a new source is required, the concrete classes
    implemented cover most use cases, if none of the current implementations
    matches their use case, they can either use a GenericSource or implement
    their own.

    Concrete classes should implement its own __repr__ method, which should
    display the source class, code (first few lines if long) and file location,
    if loaded from a file (sources can also load from strings)
