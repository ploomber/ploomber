class Env:
    """Return the current environment

    NOTE: this API is experimental and subject to change, it is recommmended
    to use @with_env and @load_env decorators instead

    Env provides a clean and consistent way of managing environment and
    configuration settings. Its simplest usage provides access to settings
    specified via an `env.yaml`.

    Settings managed by Env are intended to be runtime constant (they are NOT
    intended to be used as global variables). For example you might want
    to store database URIs. Storing sensitive information is discouraged as
    yaml files are plain text. Use `keyring` for that instead.

    All sections are optional, but if there is a path section, all values
    inside that section will be casted to pathlib.Path objects, expanduser()
    is applied so "~" can be used. Strings with a trailing "/" will be
    interpreted as directories and they will be created if they do not exist

    There are a few placeholders available:
    * {{user}} expands to the current user (by calling getpass.getuser())
    * {{version}} expands to module.__version__ if _module is defined
    * {{git}} expands to branch name if at the tip, otherwise to
    the current commit hash (_module has to be defined)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from ploomber import Env
    >>> env = Env({'db': {'uri': 'my_uri'}, 'path': {'raw': '/path/to/raw'}})
    >>> env.db.uri
    'my_uri'
    >>> env.path.raw
    PosixPath('/path/to/raw')

    Notes
    -----
    Envs are intended to be short-lived, the recommended usage is to start and
    end them only during the execution of a function that builds a DAG by
    using the @with_env and @load_env decorators
